## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ennie191/finalll_fsd.git
   ```


2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd finalll_fsd
   ```


3. **Install dependencies for both front-end and back-end**:

   ```bash
   # For back-end
   cd backend
   npm install

   # For front-end
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```


4. **Set up environment variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the necessary environment variables as shown in `.env.example`.

5. **Run the application**:

   ```bash
   # Start back-end server
   cd backend
   npm start

   # Start front-end development server
   cd ../frontend
   npm start
   ```


## Usage

Once the application is running:

- Access the front-end at `http://localhost:3000`.
- The back-end API runs on `http://localhost:5000`.

You can register a new user, log in, and perform CRUD operations on the data entities.
